# OMC3 Changelog

#### 2024-08-14 - v0.15.2 - _fesoubel_, _jdilly_

- Fixed:
  - Numpy's `ComplexWarning` was not part of main namespace in v2.0, so we import it directly

#### 2024-08-14 - v0.15.1 - _fesoubel_

- Fixed:
  - The package is now fully compatible with `numpy 2.x` on `Python >= 3.10` thanks to a `pytables` compatibility release.
  - The package still limits to `numpy < 2` on `Python 3.9` due to the lack of compatibility from `pytables` on this versions.

#### 2024-07-08 - v0.15.0 - _jdilly_

- PINNING NUMPY TO < 2.0.0

- Changed:
  - Model creation:
    - removed hard-coded `knobs.madx` from `lhc`
    - removed `corrections.madx` from `lhc` best-knowledge model
    - zip up log-output files in `response_madx.py`
    - keep 0th output file in `response_madx.py` for reference of the model setup
    - Sequence and modifiers use the acc-models symlink in madx-jobs where applicable.

#### 2024-06-05 - v0.14.1 - _jdilly_

- Fixed:
  - LHC Knobs: Fixed typo "MQSOR" to "MQSORG" in LHC Beam 2 coupling knobs.

#### 2023-12-07 - v0.13.0 - _awegsche_

- Added:
 - complete overhaul of model creation, uses now `acc-models` for LHC, PS and PSB and prints
   useful information about available model parameters. Can load from either a user defined path
   (`--path <PATH>`) or from the afs copy of acc-models (`--afs`)

#### 2023-11-29 - v0.12.1 - _jdilly_

#### 2023-11-29 - v0.12.0 - _jdilly_

    - `suffix` input parameter: adds suffix to output files, which e.g. allows running the same file 
    with different parameters without overwriting it.
    - `bunch_ids` input parameter: in case of multibunch-files only analyse these bunches.
    If not given, all bunches will be analysed, as before.

- Fixed:
  - Fixed macros and knobs usage in model_creator for Run 3 optics

#### 2022-04-25 - v0.2.6 - _awegsche_

- Fixed:
  - Only perform index merging on the `NAME` column during coupling calculation. This solves an (at the moment) un-understood issue where some BPMs would have different `S` values in different files.

- Fixed:
  - An additional knob and macros definition file has been added to reflect the knobs used by OP in the LHC Run 3. This makes sure any `omc3.model_creator` run for the LHC with `year >= 2022` has correct knobs.

#### 2022-04-07 - v0.2.4 - _fsoubelet_

- Miscellaneous:
  - The jpype1 package is not a default dependency anymore, and is instead included as a dependency in the cern and test extras. Its import is mocked where needed in omc3.
