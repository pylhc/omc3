# OMC3 Changelog

#### 2024-09-18 - v0.16.0 - _jdilly_

- Added:
  - Global Correction for LHC:
    - The correction variables in the LHC accelerator class are now handled differently internally,
      allowing new variable classes to be added to each lhc-year and user-given files in the model-directory.
    - Variable categories `MQM_ALL` added to all LHC years.
    - Variable categories `MQM_INJ_2024` and `MQM_TOP_2024` added to LHC 2024.
    - Adding a "-" in front of a given correction variable name removes this variable from the correction. Does not work for whole variable categories.
  - Tests for running `global_correction` with `omp` and `pinv` correction methods.

- Fixed:
  - Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (`omp`) in global correction runs again ([#448](https://github.com/pylhc/omc3/issues/448))
  - Corrections Check window stop-iteration issue: fixed. Single-plane files, i.e. normalized dispersion, now accepted ([#447](https://github.com/pylhc/omc3/issues/447))
  - LHC Correction variables now logged, if not found in the variable categories ([#446](https://github.com/pylhc/omc3/issues/446))

#### 2024-09-16 - v0.15.4 - _jdilly_

- Fixed:
  - Measure optics skips now using the ERRAMP column, when not present, i.e. when cleaning deactivated ([#451](https://github.com/pylhc/omc3/issues/451))
  - `hole_in_one` now allows `pathlib.Path` objects in addition to `str` ([#452](https://github.com/pylhc/omc3/issues/452))
  - Pandas to numpy dtype conversions bug ([#453](https://github.com/pylhc/omc3/issues/453)).
  - Special phases writing now skipped when accelerator has no special phases ([#454](https://github.com/pylhc/omc3/issues/454)).
  - RDT/CRDT calculation now not crashing when also giving off-momentum files; but only calculated from on on-momentum files ([#456](https://github.com/pylhc/omc3/issues/456)).

- Added:
  - Tests for full runs `hole_in_one` with on-momentum and off-momentum files.

#### 2024-08-14 - v0.15.3 - _jdilly_

#### 2024-08-14 - v0.15.1 - _fesoubel_

- Fixed:
  - The package is now fully compatible with `numpy 2.x` on `Python >= 3.10` thanks to a `pytables` compatibility release.
  - The package still limits to `numpy < 2` on `Python 3.9` due to the lack of compatibility from `pytables` on this versions.

#### 2024-07-08 - v0.15.0 - _jdilly_

- PINNING NUMPY TO < 2.0.0

- Changed:
  - Model creation:

    - removed `corrections.madx` from `lhc` best-knowledge model
    - zip up log-output files in `response_madx.py`
    - keep 0th output file in `response_madx.py` for reference of the model setup
    - Sequence and modifiers use the acc-models symlink in madx-jobs where applicable.

#### 2023-11-29 - v0.12.0 - _jdilly_

    with different parameters without overwriting it.

    If not given, all bunches will be analysed, as before.

- Fixed:
  - Fixed macros and knobs usage in model_creator for Run 3 optics

#### 2022-04-25 - v0.2.6 - _awegsche_

- Fixed:
  - Only perform index merging on the `NAME` column during coupling calculation. This solves an (at the moment) un-understood issue where some BPMs would have different `S` values in different files.

- Fixed:
  - An additional knob and macros definition file has been added to reflect the knobs used by OP in the LHC Run 3. This makes sure any `omc3.model_creator` run for the LHC with `year >= 2022` has correct knobs.
