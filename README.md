This is the python-tool package of the optics measurements and corrections team (OMC) at CERN.

If you are not part of that group, you will most likely have no use for the codes provided here, unless you have a 9km wide accelerator at home.
Feel free to use them anyway, if you wish!

## Documentation

- Autogenerated docs via `Sphinx` can be found at <https://pylhc.github.io/omc3/>.
- General documentation of the OMC-Teams software is located at <https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/BEABP/OMC>.

## Getting Started

The `omc3` package is `Python 3.7+` compatible, but not yet deployed to PyPI.
The best way to install is though pip and VCS:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pylhc/omc3
pip install /path/to/omc3
```

Or simply from the online master branch, which is stable:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/pylhc/omc3.git
```

After installing, codes can be run with either `python -m omc3.SCRIPT --FLAG ARGUMENT` or calling path to the `.py` file directly.

## Functionality

#### Main Scripts

Main scripts to be executed lie in [`/omc3`](omc3) directory. These include:
- `hole_in_one.py` to perform frequency analysis on turn by turn BPM data and infer optics and more for a given accelerator.
- `madx_wrapper.py` to start a MADX with a file or string as input.
- `model_creator.py` to provide optics models required for optics analysis.
- `run_kmod.py` to analyse data from K-modulation and return measured optics functions.
- `tbt_converter.py` to convert different turn by turn datatypes to sdds and add noise.
- `amplitude_detuning_analysis.py` to perform amp. det. analysis on optics data with tune correction.

#### Plotting Scripts

Plotting scripts for analysis outputs can be found in [`/omc3/plotting`](omc3/plotting).
- `plot_spectrum.py` to generate plots from files generated by frequency analysis.
- `plot_bbq.py` to generate plots from files generated by bbq analysis.
- `plot_amplitude_detuning.py` to generate plots from files generated by amplitude detuning analysis.
- `plot_optics_measurements.py` to generate plots from files generated by optics_measurements.
- `plot_tfs.py` all purpose tfs-file plotter.

#### Other Scripts

Other general utility scripts are in [`/omc3/scripts`](omc3/scripts).
- `update_nattune_in_linfile.py` to update the natural tune columns in the lin files by finding the highest peak in the spectrum in a given interval.
- `write_madx_macros.py` to generate madx tracking macros with observation points from a twissfile.
- `merge_kmod_results.py` to merge lsa_results files created by kmod, and adds the luminosity imbalance if the 4 needed IP/Beam files combination are present.

Examples for these scripts can be found in the [`tests`](tests) files.

## Quality checks

- Unit and accuracy tests are run automatically through CI [Github Actions](https://github.com/pylhc/omc3/actions). See our workflows in this other [README](.github/workflows/README.md).
- Additional checks for code-complexity, design-rules, test-coverage, duplication on are made through [CodeClimate](https://codeclimate.com/github/pylhc/omc3).
- Pull requests implementing functionality or fixes are merged into the master branch after review of a reviewer.

### Hints for Developers

In case you want to contribute to `omc3`'s development, you should install it in `editable` mode:
```
git clone https://github.com/pylhc/omc3
pip install --editable omc3
```

You can install extra dependencies (as defined in `setup.py`) suited to your use case with the following commands:
```
pip install --editable omc3[test]
pip install --editable omc3[test,doc]
pip install --editable omc3[all]
```
