Welcome to omc3's documentation!
================================

``omc3`` is a library for beam optics measurements and corrections in particle accelerators used by the OMC team at `CERN <https://home.cern/>`_.

It consists of various methods for frequency analysis of circular particle accelerators turn-by-turn data, as well as beam optics properties computation and correction algorithms.
In addition, it consists of several easy-to-use entrypoint scripts for data analysis, results plotting and `MAD-X <https://mad.web.cern.ch/mad/>`_ wrapping.
