Hi,

So I just confirmed with Stephane which magnets we should not use:

Philosophically:
Q4, Q5, Q6 of IPs 1 & 5
- If we face issues, we can use Q4.
- If issues persist we could use Q5 of IP1.

Q6 of both IPs, and Q5 of IP5 (RP region) are very low so should not be used.

cheers,
Felix

In General:

Do not use: 
 - kq4.l6b1 and kq4.r6b2 -> they are between dump kicker and septum
 - kq5.l2b1 and kq5.r8b2 -> they are within the injection bump 

Changes to 2024:
 - Inj: 
   Removed kq4 in IP5, added kq4 in IP1 due to polarity switch.
   In the optics these magnets are turned off.
 - Top:
   Removed kq6 in IP1, as we are not supposed to use them. (see email above)
