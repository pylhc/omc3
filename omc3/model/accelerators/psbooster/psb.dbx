/*
Christian Carli informed me that the beam scope
is the main aperture limitation in the PS BOOSTER.
The beamscope dipoles (HOR & VER): DBSHVL4 are in P7L4, P8L4 & P9L4.

PSBBCSCR0001  Scraper  https://edms.cern.ch/file/220022/0/psbbcscr0001-v0.plt
The aperture limit in the PSB is the "beamscope window", located in P8L2.
Half_length=50 mm (hor.) and half_length=28.6 mm (vert.).
It's used for transverse emittance measurement via shaving of the beam. M.Benedict
Thickness of the beamscope (WBS) = 40 mm
