    """Test the RDTs calculated by OMC3 against the analytical model and MAD-NG.

    The test checks the amplitude and phase of the RDTs calculated by OMC3 against the
    analytical model and MAD-NG. The test passes if the amplitude and phase of the RDTs
    are within 5% and 0.05 rad of the analytical model, respectively.

    Please note these are the following situations which are tested: 
    - Beam 1, Skew Sextupolar RDTs
    - Beam 2, Normal Sextupolar RDTs
    - Beam 1, Normal Octupolar RDTs
    - Beam 2, Skew Octupolar RDTs

    This selection was chosen to minimise the number of required input files, while still
    trying to cover all the different types of RDTs at multiple orders and beams. 
    Furthermore, the test does not combine skew and normal RDTs in the same test 
    for the following reasons:
        - The analytical model does not produce the correct results for these cases.
        - The OMC3 result for skew sextupolar RDTs, in particular F2010_Y becomes 
        dependent on a low kick amplitude to produce the correct results.

    The test also forces harpy to run for the selected RDTs. This is done to ensure that
    the use of the opposite_direction flag is consistent with the optics=True, beam=2 situation.

    The strength of the octupole magnets has also been chosen so that they are the 
    dominant cause of the RDTs. This is only done to have the analytical model 
    produce the more reliable results for the octupolar RDTs.
