<h1> PS lattice for space charge simulations </h1>

In general, PyORBIT space charge simulations using the PS lattice can be very time consuming. 
It is therefore advisable to include only as few elements as required in the lattice, while removing all the others using the MAD-X SEQEDIT command. On this page a MAD-X example is presented, which allows to remove all auxiliary elements from the ring apart from the low-energy quadrupoles, one 10 MHz cavity and the wire scanners.
Based on the needs of a given study, additional elements can be included in the lattice by commenting the respective line in the file *remove_elements.seq*. 

The MAD-X example furthermore includes the possibility to cycle the sequence and to create a PTC flat file for simulations in PyORBIT.
